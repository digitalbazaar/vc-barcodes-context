## Background

See related specs:

- Verifiable Credentials Barcodes
  - https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-barcodes
  - https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-barcodes

## Security

TBD

## Install

Requires [Node.js][] 20+

To install via [NPM][]:

```
npm install @digitalbazaar/vc-barcodes-context
```

## Usage

```js
import {contexts, metadata, named} from '@digitalbazaar/vc-barcodes-context';
// or
const {contexts, metadata, named} = require('@digitalbazaar/vc-barcodes-context');
```

The `contexts` [Map][] can be used to access individual contexts by id or load
them into a JSON-LD document loader. The `metadata` [Map][] contains
extra information about each context.

This package can be used with bundlers, such as [webpack][], in browser
applications.

## API

The library exports the following properties:
- `contexts`: A [Map][] associating context URLs to context data.
- `metadata`: A [Map][] associating context URLs to context metadata.
- `named`: A [Map][] associating short package specific names to context
  metadata.

Note that the `metadata` format is experimental and subject to change. The `id`
field is expected to stay stable and can be used with the `named` Map to get a
context URL for a short name such as `v1`.

The context files are available in the published `contexts/` directory. The
metadata has a URL for each context. Note that these files are semantically
equivalent to published spec contexts but the formatting may differ such that
strict file digests are not equivalent.

## Status

The following contexts are available as of early-2025. They track the published
spec contexts.

- Verifiable Credentials Barcodes v1 context
  - URL: `https://w3id.org/vc-barcodes/v1`
  - Short name: `v1`
  - Status: stable

## Developing

Source is available at:
- https://github.com/digitalbazaar/vc-barcodes-context

**WARNING**: The `.jsonld` files in `contexts/` are auto-generated by the `npm
run build` script each time the test suite is run.

DO NOT edit them directly since changes will be overwritten.

Make all context changes to `lib/*.js`.
